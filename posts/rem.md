`rem` is a unit used in CSS for calculating values relative to the font size (similar to `em`), but relative to that of the root (in most cases `<html>`) element ([Read more about using the rem unit](http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem)). Wide browser support & easily-calculated pixel fallback make this unit good to use with a fallback.
