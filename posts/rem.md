The css `rem` unit is calculated relative to font size, but based on the root element (usually `<html>`) instead of the element's parent. For a detailed comparison of `em`, `px`, and `rem`, see [this post
by Johnathan Snook](http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem).

`rem` has wide browser support & is recommended for use with an easily-calculated pixel fallback.
