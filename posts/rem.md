The css `rem` unit is calculated relative to font size, but based on the root element (usually `<html>`) instead of the element's parent. For a detailed comparison of `em`, `px`, and `rem`, see [this post

Internet Explorer 10 and 9 have quirks. For more details see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=rem).
