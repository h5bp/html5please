The `postpone` attribute is applied to an element in order to delay the downloading of the element's resource until the element is visible in the viewport. The `postpone` attribute is part of the [resource priorities draft specification](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/ResourcePriorities/Overview.html#attr-postpone) formulated by the W3C.

Although `postpone` is not yet natively supported by browsers, its functionality can be polyfilled.
