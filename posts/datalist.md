[`<datalist>`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/form-elements.html#the-datalist-element) enables autocomplete combo boxes. It can be polyfilled well with any of the scripts below, though they have [varying levels](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/issues/18) of support for the full feature. You can also use a [graceful fallback](http://adactio.com/journal/4272/) if you choose not to polyfill.
