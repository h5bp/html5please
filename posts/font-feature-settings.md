Internet Explorer 10, Firefox 4+ and Chrome 16 (Windows and Linux only) support low level control over font feature settings. What this means is other browsers merely will not render the flourishes you seek. Many features available through the property may be extracted to separate properties in the future, such as font-variant-ligatures.
