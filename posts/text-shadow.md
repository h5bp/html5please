All modern browsers support text-shadow except IE. Since it's mostly used for decorative purposes, we do not recommend using a [polyfill](https://github.com/heygrady/textshadow), just make sure the text is still legible without a text-shadow. We also advise you to avoid large text-shadows because they can have a negative impact on performance.
