Use the [Font Squirrel Generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator) for fonts you have license for using as web fonts. [Fontspring @font-face syntax](http://www.fontspring.com/blog/the-new-bulletproof-font-face-syntax) is also the most bullet-proof way of serving web fonts. You do not need polyfills - just fonts in several formats; WOFF is preferred, followed by TTF and then EOT. 

Also, don't use solutions like sIFR or Cufon anymore, as they can cause accessibility and performance problems.
