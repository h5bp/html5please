Use [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) for hundreds of free, open-source fonts optimized for the web. [Font Squirrel Generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator) for fonts you have license for using as web fonts. [Fontspring @font-face syntax](http://www.fontspring.com/blog/the-new-bulletproof-font-face-syntax) is also the most bullet-proof way of serving web fonts. Always reference several font formats; WOFF2 is preferred, followed by WOFF, TTF/OTF. If you have to support outdated browsers (like old versions of IE and iOS Safari), also add EOT and SVG font formats.
