ECMAScript version 5 covers a large number of feature additions to what we normally call JavaScript. 
Excluding IE8, [most of ES5 is supported in browsers](http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/). 
As it introduces no new syntax, it's possible to polyfill fairly well. 
The below polyfills tackle most uses of these features, but [there is an unshimmable subset of ES5](https://gist.github.com/1664895). 
Also note that some shims are known to have [edgecase compliance bugs](https://gist.github.com/1120592).
