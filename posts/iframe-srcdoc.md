polyfillurls:[srcdoc polyfill](https://github.com/jugglinmike/srcdoc-polyfill)

This attribute allows for in-line specification of iframe content.

For non-supporting browsers, you can use [this srcdoc polyfill](https://github.com/jugglinmike/srcdoc-polyfill) which utilizes script-targeted URLs to provide this functionality in non-supporing browsers.
