CSS Animations are still in flux. The Working Group has [decided to provide](http://www.w3.org/2012/01/13-svg-minutes.html#action02) a universal animation spec that would work across CSS, SVG and HTML. For now, either use animations only to provide non-essential aesthetic enhancements or use feature detection to provide an alternative experience for browsers that do not support this feature.
