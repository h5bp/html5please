CSS Animations are still in a flux. The Working Group has [decided to provide](http://www.w3.org/2012/01/13-svg-minutes.html#action02) a universal animation spec that would work across CSS, SVG and HTML. For now, use animations for providing additional glamour and use feature detection to provide alternative experience for browsers that do not support this feature in case the animation is critical.
