matchMedia provides a javascript API to see if a media query will succeed. [MatchMedia.js](https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js/) provides a shim for unsupported browsers. If you want a shim that is responsive to window resizing, you can use [this fork](http://www.paulrhayes.com/2011-11/use-css-transitions-to-link-media-queries-and-javascript/), though its limited to browsers that support css transitions.
