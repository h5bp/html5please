IndexedDB was a volatile spec for a year, but has settled down. In addition to Chrome and Firefox, IE10 will have it; Opera has not yet implemented it and Safari has not yet committed to it.

The [IndexedDB Polyfill](http://nparashuram.com/IndexedDBShim) is a polyfill for the IndexedDB APIs over WebSql. This enables IndexedDB to work on browsers that support WebSql. 
[IDBWrapper](https://github.com/jensarps/IDBWrapper) helps smooth out the cross-browser differences. You may consider falling back to WebSQL when IndexedDB isn't available, but do keep in mind that WebSQL has been abandoned.
