For several years, CSS Masks were a WebKit exclusive. However, they have recently been resuscitated, with the W3C recently publishing a new [Working Draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-masking/). Support currently remains limited to WebKit browsers, and SVG-based fallbacks are unwieldy at best, so it may be premature to use this is in a production environment. Still, there may be a future for this feature after all.
