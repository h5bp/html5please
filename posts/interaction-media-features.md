The [Media Queries Level 4 Working Draft](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries-4/#mf-interaction) adds new media query features for checking whether the user's input mechanisms support hovering ([`hover`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/hover) and [`any-hover`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/any-hover)) and how accurate they are ([`pointer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/pointer) and [`any-pointer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/any-pointer)).

The usage of polyfills is strongly recommended due to the current level of browser support (only Chrome 41 and IE 12 Tech Preview, at the time of writing). Signs currently seem positive for browser support increasing in the future.

[mq4-hover-shim](https://github.com/twbs/mq4-hover-shim) provides support in non-bleeding-edge browsers for detecting the primary pointer's ability to hover or not (i.e. the `(hover: hover)` media query).
