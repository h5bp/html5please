SVG has had good support for several years in most browsers, except for Internet Explorer. IE9 brings support, which means for oldIE you can use [SVGWeb](http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/) as a polyfill, or create SVG dynamically via [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/) (which uses a VML fallback). 

For Android Browser support, you can use [CanVG](http://code.google.com/p/canvg/). Meanwhile [D3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) is an SVG and DOM library for data visualization.
