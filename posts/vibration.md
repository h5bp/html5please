Vibration enables web apps access to a supporting device's force feedback motor.

[illyism.com](https://illyism.com/journal/vibrate-mobile-phone-web-vibration-api) has more info and a number of demos.

Being a mobile-based feature, the feature is supported in Chrome, Firefox and Opera for Android. iOS Safari, Opera Mini and IE mobile do not support it yet.
