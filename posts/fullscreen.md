The Full Screen API is available in Edge (unprefixed); IE11 (`-ms-`); Firefox 10+ (`-moz-`); and Chrome 15+, Opera 15+, and Safari 5.1+ (via `-webkit-`). A jQuery plugin is available which contains an optional fallback to a minimal-chrome browser window when the Full Screen API is unavailable. Use as a progressive enhancement for those select browsers only.
