polyfillurls: [jQuery Fullscreen Plugin](https://github.com/kayahr/jquery-fullscreen-plugin)

The Full Screen API is currently only available in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Opera.

[screenfull.js](https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js/) is a simple, dependency free wrapper for cross-browser usage of the JavaScript Fullscreen API.

A jQuery plugin is available which contains an optional fallback to a minimal-chrome browser window when the Full Screen API is unavailable. Use as a progressive enhancement for those select browsers only.
