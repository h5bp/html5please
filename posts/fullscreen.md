The Full Screen API is currently only available in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox. Chrome 16â€™s implementation is issue-ridden, 17+ is usable. A jQuery plugin is available which contains an optional fallback to a minimal-chrome browser window when the Full Screen API is unavailable. Use as a progressive enhancement for those select browsers only.
