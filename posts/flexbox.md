Unfortunately, older versions of this spec have been implemented in Gecko, WebKit and Trident. But [the spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-flexbox/) has changed significantly (starting from the syntax), hence we recommend you avoid using this until the stable version of the spec finds wide-spread implementation.
