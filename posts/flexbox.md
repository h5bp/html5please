The flexbox spec has changed significantly through three major revisions (Chris Coyier has a [post on how to tell which flexbox you're looking at](http://css-tricks.com/old-flexbox-and-new-flexbox/). [Older versions of this spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-css3-flexbox-20090723/) have been implemented in Gecko, WebKit and Trident (a tutorial covering that spec is [on HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/flexbox/quick/)). The current version is now a W3C Candidate Recommendation and is considered stable. There are presently no robust polyfills for the current spec.

The spec is now implemented in Opera, Chrome and Firefox. [Dive into Flexbox](http://weblog.bocoup.com/dive-into-flexbox/) is a good overview of the spec from Bocoup, Opera has a great tutorial to learn from: [Flexbox â€” fast track to layout nirvana?](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/flexbox-basics/). Additionally, the [flexbox docs at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes) and the [Flexbox Please!](http://demo.agektmr.com/flexbox/) tool are good references.
