The [CSS Grid Layout](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-grid-align/) specification supersedes several older ones. The feature is implemented in most moderne browsers, other than Opera Mini and partial support in Internet Explorer 10 & 11. An overview can be found at [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/). Because a somewhat large userbase still is not supported (about 15% according to [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#search=css%20grid)) we recommend you use this feature with caution.
