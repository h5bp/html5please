Using the File API added to the DOM in HTML5, it's now possible for web content to ask the user to select local files.

FileReader pairs very well with Drag n Drop to allow for drag 'n drop file uploads, and if neither of those features are present, the fallback of providing an `<input type=file>` is rather easy.
Supported in Chrome, Firefox, Opera. Safari is currently missing FileReader support.

* [FileReader](https://github.com/Jahdrien/FileReader) provides useful fallback, based on Flash, jQuery and jQuery UI.  Doesn't support readAsBinaryFile.
* [moxie](https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie) extracted from Plupload, actively maintained as of 6/3/13.
* [Mail.Ru](https://github.com/mailru/FileAPI) FileAPI â€” a set of javascript tools for working with files. Multiupload, drag'n'drop and chunked file upload. Images: crop, resize and auto orientation by EXIF.
