Filters are now supported by Firefox 35+, Safari 6+, Opera 15+, and Chrome 18+.

It's safer to use [Polyfilter - a CSS Filters Polyfill](https://github.com/Schepp/CSS-Filters-Polyfill) which supports/translates to/emulates filters on Chrome 20+, Safari 6+, Firefox 4+, IE 6-9 (but not IE 10) on desktop and iOS 6+ Safari and Chrome, and Firefox 4+ on mobile.
