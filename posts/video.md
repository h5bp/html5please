Do note you need to supply your video in various formats to cater to all browsers and fallbacks. There is also a way to do this without any scripting as explained by Kroc Camen in his article [Video for Everybody](http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody). There is also an incredibly useful service called [vid.ly](http://vid.ly) which converts video online into all necessary formats and provides a short url that detects your browser/hardware and sends the correct format. Archive.org also converts MP4 videos uploaded to OGG automatically, same with audio.
