Drag and Drop has been standardized in HTML5 based on Internet Explorer's original implementation. It therefore has wide support (except Opera), but many feel frustrated when using the API. You may want to use jQuery UI Draggable (or another JavaScript library) to handle this for you. Meanwhile the proposed [[dropzone]](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/dnd.html#the-dropzone-attribute) attribute will improve the situation as it gains browser support.
