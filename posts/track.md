[The `<track>` element](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/track/basics/) provides a mechanism of showing captions/subtitles and/or associated metadata with `<audio>` or `<video>`. The file format the `<track>` element uses is called WebVVT. Browser support for both is in progress: complete in IE10pp4, ongoing in Webkit, unknown in Opera. A polyfill is a wise choice; Captionator is the most complete and well supported. More at [Sylvia Pfeiffer's blog](http://blog.gingertech.net/2011/06/27/recent-developments-around-webvtt/).
