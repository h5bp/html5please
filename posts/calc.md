All the modern browsers except Opera and earlier versions of Safari support `calc()` which makes it easier to adopt. But do note that it can have a big impact on the layout and the consequent breaking of your design on unsupported browsers. 

You should use it with a fallback declaration, so it doesn't break browsers which don't support it.

    width: 500px; /** older browsers **/
    width: -webkit-calc(50% - 20px); /** Chrome 19-25, Safari 6 **/
    width: -moz-calc(50% - 20px); /** FF 4-15  **/
    width: calc(50% - 20px); /** Chrome 26+, FF 16+, IE 9+, and future other browsers **/
