# Contributing to HTML5 Please

You like [HTML5 please](https://html5please.com) and want to get involved?
Thanks! There are plenty of ways you can help!

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.

## Bug reports

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/h5bp/html5please/issues) is
the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests, but please respect 
the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

* Before you open an issue, use the search feature to ensure that the bug hasn't
  been reported before

* If the issues is regarding the front-end of the site, include enough information
  for us to be able to reproduce the bug.

## Submitting pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

When submitting patches, please keep the following things in mind:

* Make sure your code adheres to our styling conventions. You can use the 
  `lint:js` gulp task to check that.
* Give your PR a proper title and description.
* Keep commits focussed and give them a clear commit message. For non-trivial
  changes, try to explain the changes in the body of your commit message.
  We recommend to read ["A Note About Git Commit Messages" by Tim Pope](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
* After submitting a PR, be open for feedback and be around to perform changes 
  to your Pull Request when that's needed.
* Squash related commits together using Git's
  [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase)
  feature.
